# Program-Prison
Program Prison is a simple and easy to use batch file that allows you to stop and repeatedly kill background processes.

This has many uses, but I mainly use it for pre-installed background bloatware.

# How to use Program Prison
If you are running Windows 10 21H2 or earlier these instructions may not work.

To use Program Prison, simply download the batch file of this repository and open it in any text editor of your choice. Next, replace "inserthere.exe" in line 4 with whatever .exe program you want to imprison. For Program Prison to work correctly, you must have sufficient system elevation to manage the program you specify.

After that, simply save your edits and run the batch file.
